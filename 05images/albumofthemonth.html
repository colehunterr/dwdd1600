            My first listen to Wildflower was a couple years back, and it was an unforgettable moment. Which has strangely been a time that I look back on often. It was the beginning of Summer and <em>Saturday Night Out</em> was the first song I heard, and you could not stop me from playing it over and over, back-to-back. To me it captured this feeling of looking back on a perfectly cool summer night, running around the neighborhood with a group of friends. Where everyone's only focus for that short night was to follow the potential stored within it. For a while, that was the only song I had heard and then I took a leap and listened to the whole album, and I was not disappointed. The entire album captures that feeling of youthful freedom and brings out old memories and lays its filter over the replay in your mind. It almost feels like that is the goal of <em>Wildflower.</em> Its a sonic journey that you can almost watch in your head. As the summer's end has been crawling nearer, <em> Wildflower</em> is there to help tie a knot on the seasons end. It can help you reflect on some of the better moments of this past summer while painting the backdrop for you. Its a must-listen-to before Falls takes center stage.
