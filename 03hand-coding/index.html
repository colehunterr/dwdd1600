        <h1>Reviews:</h1>

           <h2>Grace by Jeff Buckley</h2> 
           <p>
            Jeff Buckley's album <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_(Jeff_Buckley_album)" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Grace</a> <em>(1994)</em> is a timeless classic album that I have come to love recently. The main draw to this album, and what keeps me coming back to it, is the overall sound engineering of the guitars. Throughout the album they feel as though the guitarists are performing just for you. They have a very intimate presence within the mix with elevates Jeff Buckley's vulnerable and distinguished vocals. Another element that I love is the lyrics. Buckley's writing has the ability to uncover and target fine-point emotions that you weren't even aware of. This is an album that always feels fresh and becomes more and more personable with each listen.

            <h2>Blonde by Frank Ocean</h2>
            <p>
                <em>Blonde</em> by Frank Ocean is an album that has constantly been in my rotation ever since its release back in 2016. My main draw to this album is the soundscapes and world within the sonics. Almost all of the songs on the record are pretty simple, they are usually just a dense synth pad that creates the atmosphere. Then from there it is paired with some other instrument like a guitar or (the Frank Ocean classic) an organ. It’s compelling to me that each time I listen to the album I come out of it with a new favorite song from it. I remember my first listen I was obsessed with track 1, Nikes. Then my next favorite was Self Control. This constant, “flip flopping” between crowing different songs as my favorite is due to the amount of detail that can be found and appreciated each listen. Which in the end, feels like a testament to the greatness of the album.
